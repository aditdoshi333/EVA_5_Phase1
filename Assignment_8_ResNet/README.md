# Assignment 8:  ResNet implementation

In the assignment there four files and one notebook integrating
all the files and training the model.

* train_test_transform.py : It provides transforms for train 
test data.
  
* train_test_data_loader.py : It provides data loaders for 
train and test based on the transformation config given.
  
* resnet.py : It provides ResNet model

* trainer.py : It has functions related to training and testing 
the model
